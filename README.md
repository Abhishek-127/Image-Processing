# Image-Processing
## Image Processing Toolbox for Julia 

### Release 1.2 Beta 1

Abstract
This note describes a toolbox of image processing algorithms for Julia. 

Julia is a new language for scientific computing, and due to its similarity to MATLAB, is an
excellent conduit for image processing. This toolbox contains functions to perform elementary
image processing operations. The toolbox is completely free of dependencies, meaning it does
not require any other packages to work. 

The toolbox is currently under (re)construction to make it compatible with the latest version of
Julia. It was originally written in Julia 0.6, and subsequent versions of Julia introduced some
source-breaking changes. The current version has been updated for Julia 0.7/1.0, and has the
tools you need for A1. It will be expanded to include the rest of the algorithms as we go along.
The toolbox contains the following packages:
Image sharpening: various unsharp masking filters
Noise suppression: a series of varied filters to perform noise suppression
Histogram functions: generate and manipulate histograms, eg. histogram equalization 

Noise generation: Functions to generate noise in images
Metrics: Algorithms to calculate image enhancement metrics 

All functions in this library return new/processed images, and do not modify their arguments.

To work with common image formats (e.g. PNG or JPEG), you can use additional Julia
packages:

- FileIO allows you to load those images. The resulting format is a matrix of 3 (RGB) or 4
(RGB and Alpha channel) values (https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl). To convert these
images to individual R, G, and B matrices, use the channelview() function.
Also, keep in mind that the values in the matrix returned by load() are normalized, while the
functions in our Julia library expect matrices with values between 0 and 255. You will need
to scale them by 255, and explicitly convert the result to an integer type (Julia is strictly
typed). The who process would look like this:
```julia
img = load("image.png")
mat = channelview(img)
r=round.(Int16, 255*mat[1,:,:])
g=round.(Int16, 255*mat[2,:,:])
b=round.(Int16, 255*mat[3,:,:])
```
- You can use the ImageView library to display the loaded images, and their R, G, and B
matrices (https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageView.jl)
- You can use the Plots library for plotting histograms (https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
